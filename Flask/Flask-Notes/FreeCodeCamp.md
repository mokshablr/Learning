Started learning Flask: **29-Sep-2023**!

# [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA):

## Routing:
- Routes are made using @app decorator. Eg: ```@app.route('/path')```

## HTML Formatting:
- We can make a "base template" which other pages can **inherit** from which would keep the website looking similar throughout all its pages.

- We use [Jinja2 Formatting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templating-with-jinja2-in-flask/)  in the html templates to make it accessible by python.


## Database:
- Used SQLite for the database.

- Created the structure of the database table using a class and SQLAlchemy.
